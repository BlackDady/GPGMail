GPGMail
=======

GPGMail is a plugin for OS X's Mail.app, which let's you  
send and receive secure, OpenPGP encrypted and signed messages.

Important

GPGMail currently doesn't support macOS Sierra (10.12). We're actively working on it.

Localizations are done on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/GPGMail/).

Prerequisite
------------

In order to use GPGMail you need to have GnuPG installed.
You can either build your own version, use one from [homebrew](http://brew.sh) or find a packaged version for OS X at [gpgtools.org](https://gpgtools.org)

Build
-----

#### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GPGTools/GPGMail.git
cd GPGMail
```

#### Grab Dependencies

In order to communicate with GnuPG we use our own Objective-C framework called [Libmacgpg](https://github.com/GPGTools/Libmacgpg).
It's necessary to clone the Libmacgpg repository first, before building GPGMail.

```bash
cd Dependencies
git clone https://github.com/GPGTools/Libmacgpg.git
cd ..
```

#### Build
```bash

# Catalina 10.15.1 + Xcode 11.2b2 
# -------------------------------
# In first grant Full Disk Access for Terminal and xcode application :
# choose Apple menu ï£¿ > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then select the Privacy tab.
# Scroll down and click Full Disk Access, then add the parent process (Terminal and xcode)
#
# Change Build Settings / Linking / Bundle Loader :
# /System/Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail
# (add /System)
#
# Add Build Settings / Linking / Runpath Search Paths :
# /System/Library/Frameworks (After /Library/Frameworks)
#
# Add Build Settings / Search Paths / Framework Search Paths:
# /System/Library/Frameworks (After /Library/Frameworks)
#
# There is a problem with Build phase when it's a partial build and the generation of .plist and DSYM file (custom fill info plist order)
# for pass thrue it you need to clean all before build all
#
# in mail.app if you don't have the "manage bundle/plug-ins button" you need to do :  
# sudo defaults write "/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail" EnableBundles 1

make clean
make
```

#### Install
Copy Libmacgpg.framework from Dependencies/Libmacgpg/build/Release/ to ~/Library/Frameworks.

After that copy the GPGMail.mailbundle file from build/Release/GPGMail.mailbundle to ~/Library/Mail/Bundles, re-start Mail.app and enjoy.
